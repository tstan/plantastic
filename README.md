(WIP) react app to help me and my partner plan our world travels.

Development Plan
- [ ] Basic `ideas` page logic and data structures
- [ ] Basic UI for `ideas` page
- [ ] Deploy to a github.io page (Is that how react apps work?)
- [ ] `itinerary` page backend, UI
- [ ] Print out / email complete page feature

Features TBA
- [ ] Create map/routes based on itinerary considering time spent, travel time, etc.
- [ ] Nearby search and suggestions
- [ ] Tickets and booking helper
- [ ] Attaching images, tickets stubs (persistent storage)
- [ ] Simple REST API to spit out the agenda or ideas as JSON

If you've reached this project, please feel free to recommend any other features. I'm excited to build a react application from scratch so bear with me as I build this thing.

Please do not use this to make money.
